# DeepLearningModels
 Deep neural networks implemented in keras to finetune in your dataset
 
 We implemented the main deep models and extensions. In most of them, we just modify the source code to finetune for your dataset with pretrained models.
 
 You just need to implement a code to load your dataset and modify some lines of code such as, number of classes, number of batches, number of epochs.
 
 Requirements:
 
 Keras 2.0
 Theano
 
 
 ## AlexNet
 
 I modified the implementation of https://github.com/heuritech/convnets-keras to finetune in your dataset.
